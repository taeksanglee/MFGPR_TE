This code and data implement the results shown in the manuscript entitled "Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling of pediatric tissue expansion", which is now in revision.
All details can be found in the paper once it is published.

There is one jupyter notebook and you can run it, and see the performance of low, high, and multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate model.
